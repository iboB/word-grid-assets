# Word Grid Assets

Assets builders for the game [Word Grid](https://github.com/iboB/word-grid)

Added as a separate repo so as to not needlessly overcomplicate the history of the game repo itself.

Note that this repo is not used as assets for the game. It's just what one would call "raw" files and small tools which are used to manipulate them and produce the final assets which, themselves, *are* in the main game repo.
