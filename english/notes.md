SOWPODS is just too big... it contains too many obscure words (saughy... come on!)
Ideas to improve:
* https://websites.psychology.uwa.edu.au/school/mrcdatabase/uwa_mrc.htm (available as download [here](https://github.com/samzhang111/mrc-psycholinguistics) mrc2.dct)
    * 150k entries
    * Pretty old (1988)
    * Contains many proper nouns which seem impossible to discern from the rest (example: `STONE`)
    * I may be possible to use to further refine common words based on its commonality rating
    * It has part of speech categories... may be useful for other games
    * Not yet clear if applicable for our case, though
* https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/english-word-frequency
    * Contains over 333k entries
    * Unusable as a dictionary: it's generated by scraping web pages marked as English, and a lot of them likely weren't english
    * Also, since it's scanning web pages it's ratings are *very*, skewed towards pornography and advertisement
    * Maybe (and that's a big maybe) it can be used to refine common words, but seems useless to refine uncommon ones. It contains to few uncommon words, and to many of: typos, porn-neologisms, ad-neologisms, Spanish, German, French and whatnot.
