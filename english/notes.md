# Dictionary Notes

After some experiments it seems we need a dictionary with around 150k of the most common English words. More than that makes grids too easy (random combos hit often), less than that makes them too hard (even known words are not accepted)

* SOWPODS (the Scrabble dictionary) is really good in terms of content, but:
    * 267k entries
    * It doesn't have hyphenated words
    * It doesn't have words contracted with apostrophies
    * It doesn't have diactrics
    * It doesn't have proper capitalizations
    * No common/uncommon categorization
    * It's pretty thin on neologisms like "selfie"
    * As it turns out, it's too big. It contains too many obscure words (saughy... come on!)
Ideas to improve:
* https://websites.psychology.uwa.edu.au/school/mrcdatabase/uwa_mrc.htm (available as download [here](https://github.com/samzhang111/mrc-psycholinguistics) mrc2.dct)
    * 150k entries
    * Pretty old (1988)
    * Contains many proper nouns which seem impossible to discern from the rest (example: `STONE`)
    * I may be possible to use to further refine common words based on its commonality rating
    * It has part of speech categories... may be useful for other games
    * Not yet clear if applicable for our case, though
* https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/english-word-frequency
    * Contains over 333k entries
    * Unusable as a dictionary: it's generated by scraping web pages marked as English in their meta (and a lot of them likely weren't english)
    * Also, since it's scanning web pages it's ratings are *very*, skewed towards pornography and advertisement
    * Maybe (and that's a big maybe) it can be used to refine common words, but seems useless to refine uncommon ones. It contains to few uncommon words, and to many of: typos, porn-neologisms, ad-neologisms, Spanish, German, French and whatnot.
* [12dicts](http://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts/)
    * 3of6all is a good source of capitalized, hyphenated, and contracted words. It also has a lot more (proper nouns for example), which we'll have to filter out)
    * 2+2+3frq contains words sorted by frequency
        * Again, only some inflections
        * It has no contractions
    * 2+2+2lem contians lemmatized inflections, so we can find common words in 2+2+3frq and search for inflections there
        * It also contains neologisms
    * All the words (after filters for length and porper-noun-ness) in 12dics come to 70k. That's not enough.
