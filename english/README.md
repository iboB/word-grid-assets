## Dictionary

Builders for English. Still a work in progress.

See [notes.md](notes.md) for more info

## Diactrics

Instead of searching a dictionary with diactrics, just use the manual list.

Copied from here and edited manually: https://enacademic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/3894487

## Contractions with Aphostrophe

Common ones are few. So once we have a common list with no contractions we can use the manually created list from here.

Uncommon contractions (ne'er) need to be added from somewhere (3of6all of 12dicts has plenty for example)

## Themed Categories

No idea yet what to do with themed categories
