# English

* SOWPODS (the Scrabble dictionary) is really good in terms of content, but:
    * It doesn't have hyphenated words
    * It doesn't have words contracted with apostrophies
    * It doesn't have diactrics
    * It doesn't have propper capitalizations
    * No common/uncommon categorization
* [12dicts](http://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts/) to the rescue:
    * 3of6all is a good source of capitalized, hyphenated, and contracted words (it also has a lot more, which we'll have to filter out)
    * 2+2+3cmn contains common words, but only some inflections (mostly verbal nouns)
    * 2+2+2lem contians lemmatized inflections, so we can find common words in 2+2+3cmn and search for inflections there
    * No diactrics here too
* English words with diactrics are few so they can be manually handled
    * Copy from here and edit manually: https://enacademic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/3894487
* No idea yet what to do with themed categories
